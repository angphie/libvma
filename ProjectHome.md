Mellanox's Messaging Accelerator (VMA) boosts performance for message-based and streaming applications such as those found in financial services market data environments and Web2.0 clusters. It allows application written over standard socket API
to run over Infiniband and/or Ethernet from user-space with full network stack bypass. The result is a reduction in latency by as much as 300%, an increase in application throughput by as much as 200%, higher packets rates and better CPU utilization as compared to applications running on standard Ethernet or InfiniBand interconnect networks.
